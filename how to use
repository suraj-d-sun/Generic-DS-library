Header Files(.h) : They include our custom data type created and all the names of the functions which we are going to implement.
Source Code Files(.c) : They contain the defination of all the functions which were declared in header files. These files will contain the information 
                        how the data is to managed and stored properly.
After creating source code files, object files are created which will then be used for creating our custom library.

gcc 'name of the file.c' -I 'location of the header files' -L 'location of library' -l 'name of library' -o 'name of executable file'
