# Generic-DS-library-in-C-
Ever thought creating a custom library in C. While using C++ and Java we have STL and Collection Classes respectively for managing and sorting our data easily. In this, I have created generic library in C for Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Stack and Queue.
I have created a generic library in C programming language which is used for managing and storing any kind of data type available. This thing can be easily done in C++ by using STL classes and in Java by using collection classes, but in C there is no such kind of feature available.
Some might say, why to make this libraries when it is already made in C++ or Java. Its ok but someone might the done the same thing while creating this customs classes, so why not us.
This project helped me to understand the basic understanding of Data Structures and how the pre defined classes work in a particular fashion.
